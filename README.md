### iter 2:
- fixed obs space
- added no action to action space
- fixed step logic
- #### Notes:
    constants need to be fixed before anything meaningful can come from model. Optimal strategy was not doing anything and now its max price per ride. Need to fix constants, HV model, and traveller model.
- #### To Do:
    - fix constants
    - HV model
    - dynamic traveller model
    - Hybrid Action space
    - Action mask
    - Traffic Flow model

### iter 1:
- base model

### iter 0:
- static model
